    "Given the stochasticity of the Pokémon game, the environment proves to be a good alternative to validate more robust reinforcement learning systems. However, in recent years, few reinforcement learning jobs have been willing to use Pokémon battles to validate their models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding tabular methods, the work of [Rill-García, R. 2018](https://ccc.inaoep.mx/~esucar/Clases-mgp/Proyectos/2018/reinforcement-learning-turn%20%281%29.pdf) can be mentioned. The author proposes the use of the Q-Learning algorithm. The author defines as states only the index of his active Pokémon and the opponent's. However, 301 Pokémon are considered to choose from, among the most used in competitive battles. Actions were also defined from 601 moves most used in competitive battles, plus one, referring to an action that cannot be performed. Rewards were set based on the Pokémon that passed out (their or the opponent's), the percentages of damage produced or taken, and based on an \"unable to act\" rating. The author used constant values of $\\alpha = 0.1$ and $\\gamma = 0.8$. The author used 10 different teams for validation and reported an average of $58\\%$ wins against a RandomPlayer (player who selects random actions at each turn).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another tabular method that can be cited is the work of [Kalose, A et. al. 2018](https://web.stanford.edu/class/aa228/reports/2018/final151.pdf). The authors also propose the use of the Q-Learning algorithm, however, it uses two different policies, an $\\epsilon-greedy$ and a Softmax. The authors define as states the Health Points of their Pokémon and the opponent's and the types of their Pokémon and the opponent's. The defined actions are the 4 possible moves of each Pokemon. The authors did not establish how the rewards were defined, or the alpha and gamma values used. The authors reported an average of $60\\%$ winnings against a RandomPlayer (player who selects random actions each turn) using $\\epsilon-greedy$ policy and $68\\%$ winnings against a RandomPlayer using Softmax policy."
